## Bonjour
Welcome on my profile.
I have been using github, gitlab and gitKraken for couple of years already.
With time and projects going on, it became more tedious to search into previous repositories and keep a hand on relevant data.
It also takes a tremenduous amount of time to sort information and links when writing a Resume or editing a CV for jobs ads.
So did I decided to take some time and build my own source of truth... But that is *not* what you're going to see here...as the work is ongoing and includes
tons of cumulated data to reasset, sort and modify.
